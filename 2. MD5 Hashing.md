This section involved basically taking the correct key and then finding a way to break it up into
5 values that are each 4 bytes long, and those 5 add up to the correct key. The 20 total bytes
that are input into the terminal will have to be in little endian form so that they are interpretted
correctly.

Ways to easily do that in the terminal are like so (after determining correct 5 values):
- normally you would do ./program argv[1]
- so you would have a random ascii instead of argv[1]
- so instead, to easily format hex in there you can do the following
- 
- 

$(printf "\xCC\xCE\xC5\x06\..........................")

./program $(printf "\xCC\xCE\xC5\x06\..........................")
basically this will format it into the terminal for you and so basically you can type out hex values.

One thing about this is that you have to break up the key into 5 values that are 4 bytes long that
add up to the key, and put them in little endian, and after that you have to make sure that the key
has no "null bytes", since strings are terminated by null characters, even if you happen to have a
0 hex character (0x00), then it will terminate the string at that, and you won't get the remaining
values after it so that won't work properly.

I think you can also feed in the hex input from a file that you generated using any scripting 
language using the < syntax.
