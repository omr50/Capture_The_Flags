In this part, you want to trigger the part of the code that allows you to write to the terminal.
But to do that, your key has to be set to a certain value, but you don't get to input anything
and the key value is already set. But you do get to input something into the buffer.

So we can use the buffer which uses the gets() command to fill it which doesn't protect against
buffer overflows. Variables are put in the stack in a way that earlier variables are last in the
memory because it grows upwards. So if the local variable key is in memory after the buffer,
then we can keep writing to the buffer to overwrite the key with the correct one. Some of the
commands below are helpful in doing so.

1. Check the files architecture first
```
file ./binary_name
```

2. Extract useful symbols
```
nm ./binary_name
```

3. Disassemble the binary
objdump -d ./binary_name > disassembly.txt


4. In our case we are looking for the address of specific functions so we can use grep to search 
   for their addresses with the following
```
readelf -s ./binary_name | grep <function name>
```

5. It is a 32 bit file so you can't run it  without installing some libraries first.
```
apt-get install libc6-i386
```
6. Inside of gdb you can also do the following commands to get the assembly
```
disas main

disas func
```

Since our main calls function with the incorrect key as a parameter, we want to use the disassembly
to find where that is so we can potentially change it.


We can find the address of where the key is, and the address of where the buffer is. When we find
the difference between their addresses then we will know how much data we have to fill the buffer
with to get to the place where the key is in the stack, and then we can add the bytes for the correct
key in little endian. So in our case there was 52 byte difference between the key and the buffer and
so we pass in 52 bytes, then the correct key after that in little endian, and that way we overwrite 
the key and we get to the shell where we can find the flag.

Also its good to note here how python helps a lot in creating the bytes because in python we can
create a 52 byte string with the little endian key like below:

(The key was 0xCAFEBABE, which will be added in little endian form after the buffer)

```
payload = b'A' * 52 + b'\xbe\ba\fe\ca'

with open("payload", "wb") as load:
	load.write(payload)
```

After this, we can just take the file we wrote to and send it as the payload instead of having to
write the bytes by hand or look at the ascii table.

./program < payload
