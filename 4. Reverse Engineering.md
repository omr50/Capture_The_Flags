We are given a binary and we have to use it to find the correct flag.

We notice that it is packed with upx, if we use grep we can see in the file that it is packed when
we do the following code to check the first couple of lines in the binary for hints:
```
head -n 20 ./flag
```

We could have also used grep to search.

So I installed upx, unpacked it, then we can read the symbols in gdb. Before that it did not have
symbols, whether we use nm, or try to put a breakpoint at main in gdb and run.

But now we can. Also when we run the binary we see that it says that it allocated a specific memory
address with malloc, and it says that it will place the message in there. So I use the following in 
gdb:
```
disas main
```

I see the assembly code in main and I see that the malloc sys call is used. I know that the pointer
returned from malloc will be in the rax register, so i set a break point after malloc and then i do
the following in gdb:
```
print/x rax
```
Since this is done directly on the line after malloc, we will now have the allocated address inside
of the rax register. Once that address is found, then we easily jump to it later when the strcpy has
placed the message there. I just saw one more call that was done in the binary to some value 0x4...
so I thought that might be the strcpy since that is the only other function called before exit. So I
put a breakpoint after that line. Before using continue to go to that breakpoint i printed out 
64 bytes starting from the allocated address from rax. It was a bunch of zeros (I think that is typical
of heap allocation, the OS will zero out all of the memory before returning it to you). Then I used
continue to go to the line after the second call to the mysterious function that I assume is the 
strcpy. After that I again print out 64 bytes starting from the malloc'd address. Now I see that it
is full of bytes. I convert those bytes to ascii and I get a reasonable message and then I submit
that which turns out to be correct.
