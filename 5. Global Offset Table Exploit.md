In this challenge the objective is to exploit the given 32 bit binary to print out the flag.
Only through the binary can you print the flag.

We are given a hint about compiler warnings and through that we know that the scanf
functions are called incorrectly in the login function. The integers are directly passed in
there, not the addresses of the integers. Therefore if we can find a way to overwrite the
value of the integers, we can find a way to choose any address that we actually want to
over write using the scanf.

So when we take a look at the welcome function and disassemble it, we realize that the
char array of size 100 is used to input a value, and scanf will write it correctly in that array.
But we realize that since welcome is called first and then it is popped off the stack and then
login is called after, they may actually share part of the stack. And since the stack is not zero'd
out after its use, the function that may use the same part later on may see these random garbage
values as the "initial" values to their variables if they have not been initialized correctly yet. So we
do realize that the char array of size 100 in the welcome function, and the first integer in the 
login function both share memory, more precisely the last 4 bytes. Therefore we can write 96 bytes
of anything, and the last 4 bytes will be the address of something we want to overwrite. 

This is where the GOT exploit comes in (ADD MORE INFO LATER, RESEARCH THE TOPIC)
